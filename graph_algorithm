"""


Directions:
    * Complete the graph algorithm functions given below. Note that it may be
      helpful to define auxiliary/helper functions that are called from the
      functions below.  Refer to the README.md file for additional info.

    * NOTE: As with other assignments, please feel free to share ideas with
      others and to reference sources from textbooks or online. However, do your
      best to attain a reasonable grasp of the algorithm that you are
      implementing as there will very likely be questions related to it on
      quizzes/exams.

    * NOTE: Remember to add a docstring for each function, and that a reasonable
      coding style is followed (e.g. blank lines between functions).
      Your program will not pass the tests if this is not done!
